# Integers-to-squares-and-cubes

### Instructions
Write a method in python that will create two separate text files after reading the source text file named integers.txt that contains 20 integers. The first output file will be named double.txt containing the square of all even integers found in integers.txt and the second file will be named triple.txt containing the cube of all odd numbers found in the integers.txt.

#### Note
- You can try to delete the double.txt and triple.txt file before testing to see if program fully works
